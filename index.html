        <p>It was a bright and sunny day...</p>
        <p>Amanda, Mary, and Dhara were hard at work 
            with the new class coding project. When all of a sudden,</p>
        <h3>Github is fun!!</h3>   
        <p><em>Pulling, committing, and pushing again they build their website.</em></p>
        <p>This is great practice, let's do it one more time! Mary is about to
            break out with some tunes.</p>
